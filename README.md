# TATA-Data-Visualisation-Virtual-Internship
âž¼ By analyzing sales trends and customer data, I developed interactive dashboards that provided actionable insights, contributing to a 103.5% increase in sales over the year.

âž¼ Leveraging Power BI, I visualized revenue patterns by country, month, and customer segments, enabling data-driven decision-making. This improved customer engagement and optimized marketing strategies, leading to higher retention rates and enhanced profitability.

âž¼ Additionally, real-time inventory tracking and sales performance analysis helped in identifying demand fluctuations, ensuring better stock management and reducing supply chain inefficiencies.

âœ… Here's what I discovered:

### âœ¤ Task 1 - Defining Business Scenarios
I worked with an online retail store dataset, analyzing key metrics and identifying critical business challenges. This process improved my ability to formulate insightful questions for executives like the CEO and CMO, enhancing my data interpretation skills.

### âœ¤ Task 2 - Selecting the Right Visuals
By engaging in multiple-choice assessments, I developed a strong understanding of how to choose appropriate charts and graphs to represent data effectively. This strengthened my ability to present insights in a clear and impactful manner.

### âœ¤ Task 3 - Designing Engaging Visuals
Using Power BI, I explored various visualization techniques to create interactive and insightful dashboards, enhancing my ability to communicate complex data effectively.

### âœ¤ Task 4 - Presenting Insights & Analysis
I applied my analytical skills to extract meaningful insights from data and effectively communicate findings, enabling better business decision-making through data-driven storytelling.

### Project Overview
This project focused on gathering business requirements from stakeholders, pre-processing datasets, and developing a data visualization dashboard aligned with business intelligence needs.

The dashboard is structured into one key section:
ðŸ”¹ Revenue Analysis â€“ Evaluates overall sales performance.

### ðŸ’  Data Source
Online Retail Data â€“ This dataset was obtained from the Virtual Internship on Forage by Tata Group, under the program "Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights."

### ðŸ’  Tools Used
âœ… Excel â€“ Data cleaning and preparation.

âœ… Power BI â€“ Dashboard creation and data visualization.

### ðŸ’  Data Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

Data loading and inspection.

Handling missing values.

Data cleaning and formatting

### Key Insights:
1. Peak Sales Months (High Revenue Periods)

ðŸ”¹ November (1.16M revenue) and October (1.04M revenue) show the highest sales, indicating a surge in demand, likely due to: Holiday shopping season (Black Friday, Christmas 
   preparations).
   Year-end sales and discounts attracting more customers.

ðŸ”¹ September (0.95M revenue) also marks a strong sales period, possibly due to back-to-school shopping and early holiday preparations.


2. Low Sales Months (Slow Periods)
 
ðŸ”¹ February (0.45M revenue) and July (0.65M revenue) show lower revenue, which could be due to:
   Post-holiday slump in January-February.
   Summer vacation period (July) where customers might spend less on retail.

3. Gradual Sales Growth Pattern
 
ðŸ”¹ Sales show a gradual increase from March to May, followed by a slight dip in summer (June-July) before rising again in the fall-winter months (Augustâ€“December).
